# Fraymakers API Docs

This repository contains the scripting API documentation for the game [Fraymakers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1420350/Fraymakers/). The goal of these docs is to provide an extensive list of all available functions and variables available for custom Fraymakers content creation. Everything here is still a work in progress and will be gradually updated over time.

* [Core API Documentation](docs/classes/Readme.md)
* [Hscript Documentation](docs/hscript/Readme.md)

### ⚠️ Note: The vast majority of this documentation is programmaticaly generated, so this repo will not accept pull requests.
